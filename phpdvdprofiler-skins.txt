Skins
Instructions for creating a phpDVDProfiler skin from a DVDProfiler skin.

Navigate to the DVD Profiler's TEMP folder. This folder is named TEMP and is
located in the main DVDProfiler folder 
(e.g. C:\Program Files\InterVocative Software\DVD Profiler\TEMP).


In this TEMP folder you will find two directories (DESIGN and PREVIEWS) and
possibly lots of other files. Delete all of the other files, leaving DESIGN
and PREVIEWS alone.

Start DVDProfiler


Select "Skins..." from the View menu.


Highlight the skin you want to use, and click "Edit Skin".


Pick "Export to HTML File" from the File menu. In the file chooser, save the
file into the TEMP directory as above.


Next go to the Images tab, and click on each image in turn to preview it.
This will cause each of the image files to be extracted into the TEMP
directory.


The TEMP directory now contains all of the files required for a
phpDVDProfiler skin. I would recommend copying them to another, empty
directory for safe keeping until you can put them into your phpDVDProfiler
installation.


phpDVDProfiler looks for skins in a subdirectory of the main phpDVDProfiler
directory named "skins". Inside the skins directory should be
subdirectories: one for each skin (the name can be anything you like).
phpDVDProfiler searches each subdirectory of the skins directory for files
ending in ".htm" or ".html" and considers these to be skin files.
