	- boxset association doesn't occur when searching. This is
	  because I can't get the records to order properly.
	- collection=loaned ignores boxchildren. This is related to
	  the above problem with displaying boxsets when searches happen.
	- need a TitlesPerPage userpref
	- pagination needs pages, not just previous/next

	- boxset spacing is whack
	- this doesn't account for people who don't have gd as part of php ...

	- update can break with media-type issue if offset is borked
